 # Election-Audit Summary
 
After looking at the overall election results, some takeways include the fact that script can be easily modified to display data in the format needed. Using script can help filter the information down to make the data easily digestable. We were able to format the data by the amount of votes by county as well as by candidate. Script provides the oppporunity to manipulate the data based on business needs.

This can be beneficial when analyzing results for future elections.
